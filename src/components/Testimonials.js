  { feedback: "Having Kyle design my website for my gym was a great decision. I love how easy my new site is to view and overall look. Working with Kyle was Easy. He checked in regularly, while designing it and took the time to ask important questions and gathering information, so my website represents what The Shed is about." },
  { feedback: "I studied with Kyle at the University of Washington Bootcamp and can vouch for his hard work and quick grasp of complex topics. He's not just a problem solver; he elevates the whole team, helping us troubleshoot bugs and sharing insights from additional languages he took the initiative to learn. Kyle's already successfully designing client projects and would be a fantastic addition to any team." },
