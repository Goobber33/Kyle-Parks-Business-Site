  { feedback: "Kyle and I studied together during the University of Washington Bootcamp and I am very thankful that he was there. Kyle is an extremely hard worker and captured complex topics and issues quickly. Kyle was quick to assist other students (including myself at times) and troubleshoot bugs no matter when the due date was. Kyle frequently took learning to the next level and challenged himself to learn additional languages and tricks during the bootcamp which he always shared with others. Kyle is ambitious and follows through on his plans and is already successfully designing websites and applications for his clients. Kyle would be a great addition to any team." },
